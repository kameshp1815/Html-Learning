<main>
    There's a single <main> landmark element. The <main> element identifies the main content of the document. 
    There should be only one <main> per page.

<aside>
    The <aside> tag in HTML is used for extra or side content that is related but not essential to the main content. 
    It is often used for sidebars, ads, author info, or related links.

<article>
    The <article> tag in HTML is used for independent, self-contained content that can stand alone. 
    It is often used for blog posts, news articles, forum posts, or any content that makes sense on its own.

<section>
    The <section> tag in HTML is used to group related content together within a webpage. 
    It helps organize a webpage into meaningful parts, like different sections of an article, a product page, or a homepage layout.
